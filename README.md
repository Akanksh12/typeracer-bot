## Typeracer bot
How to use:
* have a python interpreter installed(I used python 3.8)
* install webdriver_manager and selenium using pip or any way possible
* have chrome installed on your machine

# Note:
I have made a file named run.bat, it installs the packages on the go and runs the python file

As you can see... it can be very disastrous.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
